    <h3 style="color: rgb(42, 42, 49);">1. Reviewing the ongoing use of IT tools when making the website.
        </h3>
<p>When reviewing the software tools that I have used throughout my website build, I would say that I am happy with them yes. 
    Trello is my favourite tool, as mentioned already the tool is great for collaboration but also good for planning and organising tasks to comeplete for any given project. I understand the tool, I use it well and it helps me a lot. Staying organised is something that is important to me in order to keep productivity levels high. I would use Trello in the same way for my next project. 
    Visual Studio Code has been a steeper learning curve than technologies such as Trello and Slack. I have found it tough to navigate at times and would of appreciated a little more time to get familiar with its features. 
    I would maybe structure my website code more neat and tidy for my next project when using V.S Code, that way it is easier to read and to amend if needed. 
    When researching for the content of my website I steered clear of Wikipedia and looked for trusted, well informed and sites. I trusted the information that I read because the content which I had used for research was highly shared and interacted with. I took most of my research information from the most popular Google sites which were professionally presented and again, well inbteracted with. I also didnt come across information which seemed false or fake news. 
    
    </p>

    <div class="center">
        <h3 style="color: rgb(42, 42, 49);">2. Describe whether the IT tools selected were appropriate. 
            </h3>
<p>My personal experience of using Visual Studio Code to build my blog website was a pleasant one. As someone who has never written code before, the tool was a great partner in achieving my goal.
V.S Code has helped me to learn and correct my mistakes when coding through itsfeature of the colour coding system. The colour codes are instant indicators for errors, which I found
extremely helpful aid to my learning. I have used notepad during sessions in Trafford College, however, as there is no spell check or word count I didnt find it helpful for corrections and counting the amount
of words I wrote for my assignment. I had to use word at home to check spellings and another website to check word count. It was fine and didnt take up too much time so that wasnt a huge issue.
Slack was perfect for group communication, file sharing and code sharing. Trello was a great work tool for collaboration and organisation of tasks and projects, Trello is my favourite work tool I will continue to use it for personal tasks.
For the group Text-based game I found that using Python was definitely appropriate, although I opted to download PyCharm as it is similar to V.S Code in terms of colour coding and highlighting errors. I found PyCharm more appropriate for my learning.
Overall, I would say yes, the technologies I used while on the course with Code Nation were appropriate for the tasks which we were expected to complete.

    <div class="center">
        <h3 style="color: rgb(42, 42, 49);">3. Assess the strengths and weaknesses of your final project. 
                </h3>
    
    <p>I am very proud of my website/ blog. Partly because it is my first project and I have wanted to build my own website for a while, therefore it is definiteley a proud moment! I am happy to have learnt the skills needed to do my own blog site, this proves that I have made progress these past 3 weeks and thats what I wanted. 
            I would say that the strongest elements of my website lie in its functionality, I feel the content has been completed to a good standard with parts of it 'selling' me quite well, plus the appearance is clean and professional looking and this was an important goal for me. 
            The weakest elements and the ones which I would have liked to improve on, I would suggest, lie in the level of skill that I have and the use of software tool such as HTML and CSS. With further learning and a real grasp of the technologies I could of had a stronger end product; Menu bar with engaging features, better structure, a better selection of imagery and social media links  and I also could of referenced better. 
            overall I am happy with the outcome of my first website project. If I could go back and do anything different, I would have studied more before taking on the assignment if time permitted. Failing that I would have spent a little more time planning the structure and design as decisively as possible. Also, instead of doing some content and then some design, and then back to working on content, I would have opted to complete each section before moving to another section. 
            </p>


    <div class="center">
        <h3 style="color: rgb(42, 42, 49);">4. Possible further improvements to my project.
            </h3>
        <p>I would have loved to have had an additional page with contact information, a menu bar and extra buttons.
                I could definitley improve the overall look by being more creative when selecting images. I would have liked to have added social media links and to have set up a Linkedin account to enhance the professional feel of the blog.
                I feel that by making these improvements, the site would appear more engaging and more professional which is ultimately the most important thing. 
                     </p>
            

    <div class="center">
        <h3 style="color: rgb(42, 42, 49);">5. Review outcomes to make sure they match requirements and are fit for purpose.

        </h3>
      <p>I feel that the outcome of my website was a satisfactory. Time was obviously a little thin on the ground as we have had a lot of material to cover, which impacted on the original vision that I had for the project. For example, I had planned to do two content pages and a welcome page; which would have my contact details. I didn’t have time to do the contact page due to the deadline, I did manage to complete my content and provide references however, which was the most important part of the assignment, so I am happy about that.
            I would have liked to have sourced some more creative imagery, due to deadline however time was restricted. With that being said, I am satisfied with the look I have achieved. It is clean and professional looking and that is what I wanted.
           I would have liked to add more features like menu and extra buttons for page navigation, however my website is fully functional which is the priority. The other thing that I am happy about is that I have never written code before and I have managed to complete this project to a working standard so I am quite proud. I wanted a blog site to act as a digital portfolio which I achieved and for that I beleive the outcome matched the requirements for this assignment.
           
       </p>

    <div class="center">
            <h3 style="color: rgb(42, 42, 49);">6. Review the benefits and drawbacks of IT tools and systems used in terms of productivity and efficiancy.
        </h3>
       <p>The technologies that I used to complete my website blog include Trello, Slack, V. S Code, Microsoft Word, Notepad, the internet, a laptop and Google Chrome. 
            I found Trello to be a great tool for breaking down all the different sections, or tasks, that were required to be completed for the project. I feel that Trello actually enhances productivity and efficiancy by allowing for time saving task organisation. It  helped me with my planning my website content and task management in general.
            Slack was helpful in terms of communication and easy information sharing between myself and the tutor. Much more efficiant than communicating via email, which was good when a quick answer to any questions was required, again enhancing my productivity. 
            Visual Studio Code was a new technology that I had to learn in order to complete my website build. I have never used V.S. Code previously, therefore I experienced a decrease in productivity relative to Trello and Slack. I had to learn how to navigate the software, write code in HTML and CSS and also mastering the way in which files are creating and saved. With this learning curve that I had to go through, I did become pushed for time and therefore I would conclude that I wasnt as productive or efficiant as I would have liked to be. Further learning is required for me to be able to increase my time efficiancy and productivity levels here.
            My research was conducted on the internet using Google Chrome, in order to find the answers to my assignment questions. With the internet being a place for both true and false information, I decided to stay away from Wikipedia and other questionable internet sources. Instead I focused on reputable sources. To get the most reliable information and also to save time on searching for sources, I used Google as directed by the tutor at Code Nation, checked the sources to see if they have been highly interacted with and used the first page of Google resullts that I was presented with. I found some information which was good for my assignment and some information which was not so good. Therefore I couldn't have been any more time efficiant in my research, as it takes time to read through and conclude findings. I wanted to do this properly and so I feel that I really did the best I could with the time given to me. 
            Using a laptop was perfect for the project that I had to comeplete, I would not have changed this for any other IT system. 
            Microsoft word would have been better than Notepad, purley for the word count and spell check features. We had Notepad available on the laptops that Code Nation provided, however, I used Microsoft Word when I went home for the extra features. This impacted my productivity and efficiancy levels a little, but not so much that it caused me any real issues. 
            Overall I felt that I was very productive and efficiant during this project. I am glad that I have risen to the challenge of producing this digital portfolio by myself. I would suggest that working in a team would have saved time and increased productivity, I definitely could of learned more from the other team members too. 
            </p>


    <div class="center">
            <h3 style="color: rgb(42, 42, 49);">7. Ways in which to improve productivity and efficiency.
        </h3>
        <p>Efficiency could have been increased if the website blog was completed as a team project. More hands on deck could have been a great time saver. Of course, we are all at different levels in terms of tech skills here at Code Nation. Therefore, I could have benefited from sharing information and resources and learning from other members in a team, possibly increasing my knowledge of technologies such as V.S Code and also languages such as HTML and CSS, saving time by increasing my time efficiency and productivity. Lastly, Microsoft word would have been my first choice of text editor, purely for the features such as word count and spell check, which were not available with Notepad. I feel that I would of saved a little time here and been able to spend that time on other tasks. 
        </p>


    <div class="center">
            <h3 style="color: rgb(42, 42, 49);">8. Develop solutions to improve own productivity using IT in digital projects 
            </h3>
        <p>To improve productivity on my next project, I would like to gain a deeper knowledge of V.S Code, HTML and CSS. Learning these technologies to a greater extent will allow me to work faster, thus, increasing productivity. 
                I work well in a team, as well as by myself. There are advantages to both. I like working in a team as we can share knowledge and resources with eachother, as well as sharing the work load. Therefore, I feel that working within a team would increase productivity levels. However, I also like to complete assignments by myself for my own development. Also as mentioned, the use of Microsoft Word would be my preferential text editor. 
                </p>

        
    
    <div class="center">
            <h3 style="color: rgb(42, 42, 49);">9. Describe how you would go about testing digital solutions 
            </h3>
        <p>The testing of digital solutions is conducted in two ways. 
                The first type is the testing of the unit, or code.
                A version of unit testing is usually carried out throughout a project, regularly and at various stages. 
                Developers will usually test their code when completing each section of the project and rectify any errors by de-bugging.
                Once a project has been completed, the code will be run and tested to confirm that it works without any errors and the result is 
                the desired outcome. With time being limited on the course with Code Nation, official unit testing was not permitted, however I was able to test 
                my code in various way to confirm that my programming was at an funcational standard.
                
                The second type of testing is user testing. This confirms that the digital solution is functional, easy to navigate and use and that the user experience
                is as desired. Again, as time was limited on the Code Nation course I was unable to officially user test my website. However, it will be user
                tested by my tutor and also tested when it is graded. 
                
                </p>

     <div class="center">
             <h3 style="color: rgb(42, 42, 49);">10. Design a website as if you are a consultant. Describe the content and layout for each page of your consultancy website.
            </h3>
        <p>My consultancy website will be branded with my own logo which will be designed to look simple and clean. I would need to design a draft and then have it finished to a professional standard by a graphic designer. The logo will be situated top left on my web pages.
           My website will have five pages, which will be laid out with the menu buttons in the top right area, my images will be PNG for quality, which I will keep top-centre of the body on all pages for uniform. The images will have text in front with a faded-out image in the background. Text will appear underneath the image on all pages, including the blog page, which will also feature images down the left side and accompanying article titles to the right.
            The home page will feature an image of me along with details of my personality, hobbies and interests. The home page will also have my current job role (programming consultant) and my availability for work, along with how I work, for example face-to-face, video call, telephone etc.
            Page two of my website will detail my tech skills; languages that I have learnt and that I am currently learning. Projects; such as the group text-based game and my portfolio blog site and any projects which I am currently working on.
            Page three is my blog page, in here I will create and curate relevant and targeted content for interested users. I will research my client base and complete profiles which will help me to choose the most engaging content to share.
            Page four of my site will be a ‘how I built it page’ where I describe how I designed and created the site, I can share all the tools and technologies that I used and be transparent in the strengths and weaknesses throughout the duration of the project. Being open might help other people who are building a website, which means I am creating value for my users, good for brand.
            The last page will be the contact page where I will have my email, phone, social media and address for anybody wanting to get in touch with me.
            The colour of the site will be the same throughout, I would like a light and clean appearance. White and grey or white with blue would be my preference. I want a professional look and so the choice of colours should be simple and provoke a feeling of expertise and trust.</p>

        <div class="center">
                <h3 style="color: rgb(42, 42, 49);">11. Copyright and other constraints affecting websites.
            </h3>
        <p>My website and the content that I share will be created by myself, therefore I would think there would be an issue of copyright infringement. UK Copyright law states that any creation, such logo’s, art, music, works of writing and photography etc, is automatically protected by law. Therefore, anything that I create is legally mine and cannot be infringed upon or used by anybody else.
          This is something that website owners need to be very careful about especially when sourcing content and images for their site. Permission must be given from the original creator of the material.
            Open source content is free and can be used by anyone for commercial purposes, which makes it an option to source content and images for my sight.
            Another regulation which website owners can be restricted by such GDPR (General Data Protection Regulations), which grants more control in favour of the user, regarding the way in which websites collect, store and use data. Having a privacy policy on the site can encourage trust and increase engagement. Users want to feel safe and being as open as possible can enhance trust and loyalty. [1]

        <div class="center">
            <h3 style="color: rgb(42, 42, 49);">12. Access issues for people with disabilities. 
            </h3>
        <p>People who suffer from disabilities such as impaired motor skills, hearing and vision impairment, dyslexia and who might be epileptic, might have restricted access to my website.
           For example, if somebody has difficulty hearing or seeing, they may struggle to engage with the pages, since they cannot see or hear the content.
            The Equality Act 2010 and WCAG and The Public Sector Bodies (Websites and Mobile Applications) (No. 2) Accessibility Regulations 2018, state that non-public websites are exempt from compliance.
         I would like to make my website more accessible and so I would try and implement some functions to allow the user to adjust the written content font size and colour, to add subtitles to any videos that I create and share and exclude flashing images on my website. [2]
                
                </p>
                 
        <div class="center">
            <h3 style="color: rgb(42, 42, 49);">13. The appropriate filetypes for websites.
                </h3>
        <p>The appropriate file types to use for my website will be; CSS, which stands for cascading Stylesheet and HTML (Hyper Text Mark-up Language). These files will be used to programme and style the website pages.
             For images, the preferred choice is PNG (Portable Network Graphics). PNG is typically a bigger file size than its common counterpart JPG, short for JPEG (Joint Photographic Experts Group) file, however PNG does not loose quality when saved as it is ‘lossless’, unlike the ‘lossy’ JPG file.
            AVI (Audio/Video Interleaved) is a file that is suitable for websites as a video format which is supported by the windows platform. They do not stream; therefore, the whole video would need to download before the user can view it. A video file format choice that allows for streaming could be MPEG (Motion Picture Experts Group File) MP3 is a good quality sound file which can be used for any possible pod casts in the future, should I choose to produce any for my website blog.
