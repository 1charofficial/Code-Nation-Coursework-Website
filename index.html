    <h3 style="color: rgb(42, 42, 49);">1. About Me</h3>

    <p> Business, Technology and Science enthusiast. My education background is rooted in Professional Studies and Business Management. I graduated class of 2018 from Manchester Metropoitan University as a mature student after doing a 4 year degree. 
            I have work experience in the Plant and Conveyancing industry and possess some sales skills and experience. I believe that life is about continuously pushing boundaries, the more challenging the environment, the more I enjoy the work and the more I thrive.
            I am always learning, developing and working towards achieving greatness (or at least what I define as greatness!). <br>
            I came to Code Nation looking to gain knowledge, skills and a career in programming. I find coding fascinating and I am eager to become an expert within this field. 
            Coding has been a challange and in terms of learning, has forced me out of my confort zone, which I love. I like to use my brain and learn new things, the bigger the challenge, the more I rise to it! I have found the people at Code Nation to be friendly and helpful and have met some really nice people. We have no problem sharing knowledge and resources here, which adds to Code Nation being a nice environment to learn in. [1]

    <h3 style="color: rgb(42, 42, 49);">2. The Purpose of IT Systems In The Modern World
        </h3>
    <p>We have gone from handing out business cards, posting brochures to potential clients and revieving cheques, to connecting on Linkedin, emailing  potential clients and recieving electronic transfers. 
            Information Technology allows businesses around the globe to become more efficient in terms of increased productivity, costs and waste reduction, ease of team collaboration, and streamlining  business and sales processes. 
            Data handling and storage, as well as financial transactions can be dealth with anywhere around the globe, from the touch of a button. 
            Without current IT systems the modern world of business would find it impossible to be as socially connected to potential and existing customers. IT systems allow for the creation and maintenaince of customer relationships without ever meeting face to face. 
            Furthermore, internal businesses proceses can be managed through IT systems such as HR and recruitment, finance and accounting, email communications in the management of teams and co-ordination of business related goals and objectives.[2]

    <h3 style="color: rgb(42, 42, 49);">3. The methods, skills and resources needed to complete digital projects successfully.
        </h3>
    <p>In modern business a successful digital project is the sum of many individual resources, skills and systems, which are co-ordinated to solve problems and deliver resuts in line with ROI and business objectives.
            A digital project manager is required to possess more skills than merely an ability to create digital products. To complete a successful digital project, leadership skills and strong organisation skills, in addition to an ability to demonstrate attention to detail are essential to the success of digital projects.  Furthermore, a digital project manager should be capable of monitoring, assessing and evaluating projects with a skill to simplify complex workflows. Planning, execution and the delivery of web-enabled projects which use the internet and other digital software rescources, from the initial idea to go-live and beyond, togther with technicle skills and knowledge are at the core of developing a successful end product. 
            Digital project managment involves the use of technological recourses such as the internet, online callaboration software such as Trello, cloud file storage systems and comminication software solutions such as Slack in order to deliver complete and disirable outcomes.[3]

    <h3 style="color: rgb(42, 42, 49);">4. How I plan and carry out tasks using IT 
    </h3>
        <p>One of the most important drivers for the sucessfull completion of a task or project, is a well devloped plan. A good plan
                is dynamic and will be expected to change and be updated throughout the life of the project, which is why digital software tools are a 
                great way to manage work related tasks. Collaboration tools such as Trello make it easy for me to organise both individual 
                and group projects 
                
                Trello is a management tool that uses the Kanban Style system. It works just as a pin board with post-it notes. 
                The Trello board represents the project as a whole and each post-it, or card, represents each individual task. 
                I like using Trello because it is easy to break down a project into smaller tasks, likewise to break down a task into 
                smaller pieces that are easy to complete. Trello allows us to collaborate and oversee the work that is being done, work that is still to be done and 
                work that has been completed. 
                
                For example when creating my website I would also use Trello, the internet, email, and other software such as Visual Studio Code, CSS and Java Script. 
                Hardware such as a laptop or smart phone are obvious essential componants. When working within a team I would use Slack, which is a messeging platform for work teams.  
                Slack is a fantastic tool for communiation and file sharing. Keeping teams connected and up to date with what is happening. <br>

    <h3 style="color: rgb(42, 42, 49);">5. What risks impact digital projects in a negative way? What causes digital projects to fail and why?
    </h3>
        <p>A large percentage of digital projects fail, infact around 80% of digital transformation projects will be considered a failure. 
                The disparity between expectations and the end result is a major reason why digital projects are not seen as a successful 
                outcome. Some of the main reasons for this high percntage of failure can be; <br>
                
                Planning - A well developed plan should recognize a realistic time and budget for completion, allow for changes during product development, 
                identify the recources and skills needed for success and also include risk mitigation. When a plan looks at possible risks
                and contingency planning, the probability of failure is reduced and the potential for success increased. Planning for after lunch is vital and 
                should not be left until the last minute. Planning helps to bring clarity and ensures that everybody involved is on the same page.<br>
                
                Human Resource - Unclear project requirements - Having the required expertise and staying connected and engaged with all people involved. A strong experiences team, 
                of the correct number of members (as in, not too little or too many) is crucial. A misconseption is that
                a digital project requires digital employees, when in fact people with expertise in
                business process and business strategy are just as important. Furthermore, anybody involved in signing off the project should be consistantly 
                kept in the development loop and updated regularly. Leadership is crucial. Sucessful projects need good leaders with great management skills.
                Doing so can  increase chances of sucessful and desirable
                outcome as any unrealistic expectations, along with product changes can be dealt with immediatly if communication is fluid.  
                Being open and practicing fluid communication with everybody involved can staying connected to the clients or the rest of the team. <br> 
                
                Business Process - All to often the hype of new technology overshadows business process implications. Projects are started and developed 
                without being alighned with core business goals and digital strategy. New and innovative digital products become successful 
                when they are built to be integrated into business operations and contribute towards the overall business objective. Being realistic with expetation and 
                being prepared to work on the product after launch is also important, sometimes everything cannot be featured in the first release. 
                Expectations must be equal to reality. <br>

                Amongst other risk factors, the expectation of the end product should be clearly understood by all involved in the project. The last thing
                you want is to create a product which does not live up to expectations.[5]

    <h3 style="color: rgb(42, 42, 49);">6. How to go about selecting the right Technologies.
    </h3>
        <p> Although it is tempting to go for the newest and 'coolest' product out there, there are definite advantages to sticking with the concencus and what you know. Mature technologies that are widely applied and languages that are known by the majority can offer a safer option when starting a new projec. When selecting the most suitable technoligies for the job bare in mind that the selction should make your's and your team's life easier, not more stressful. 
            Technologies such as Trello, PyCharm and Visual Studio Code have proved to be great tools for me when planning and executing projects at Code Nation. Trello is amazing for planning and organising tasks and projects, it works just as well for personal organisation as well as work purposes.  HTML (HyperText Markup Language) which is used for building pages and making them functional, it is the language in which most websites are coded with, this is the language that I used to code my website. I will use notepad or Micrisoft word as a draft for my website cntent. I have also used CSS which allowed me to style my pages on my blog to make it more appealing. 
            Trello will be my main technology for organising and planning my projects, whether group or individual projects. I can see what I need to do, what I have done and what I am working on currently, keeping my project neat and tidy.[6]</p>

        <h3 style="color: rgb(42, 42, 49);">7. An analysis on how my chosen technologies have helped me achieve my outcomes. How git and GitHub help with codes version control?
     </h3>
        <p>The technologies that I have worked with while at Code Nation include slack, Trello, Draw.io, Visual Studio Code and the internet. I have also programmed with computer languages such as HTML, Python and CSS. 
            Building a blog website from scratch has been a new challange for me, however Trello has been a great assist and is a an invaluable software tool for work collaboration, task organisation and staying up to date with projects. Working in a team without access to Trello would mean that more time and effort would be wasted in trying to track the status of a project in real time. This tool really does make life easier for teams working togther on projects. My favourite thing about Trello is the way in which I can organise my tasks and be maticulous when planning out tasks for my website/blog project, in terms of work that I have actioned, need to action and am currently working on.
            Slack messenger has been great for keeping in touch with my team while working on the team project; Programming a text-based computer game. Sharing files, information and resources and also being easily connected on and off college campus. Slack is a really good tool. Git is a code version control system which is downloaded locally, GitHub is a code repository system and an open source, cloud-based hosting service. Git and GitHub are useful technologies for me and other programmers, making it easy to save and re-call records of all versions of code. The great benefit of using GitHub is that it allows for team collaboration and the merging of codes on development projects, making it an invaluable tool for teams working togther.
            Draw.io was beneficial to plan and control the team project that I worked on, allowing us to map out our intentions for the Text-based game. Having that visual with us throughtout the project gave us vision, organisation and team cohesion.

        <h3 style="color: rgb(42, 42, 49);">8. Legal guidelines and constraints that impact digital projects. How GDPR impacts digital projects?
        </h3>    
        <p>The general Data Protection Regulations or (GDPR) came into effect 25th May 2018 and is the biggest data law overhaul in the last two decades. The new privacy landscape which is designed to protect EU citizens, applies to every business, charity and not-for-profit organisations. The regulations applies to all organisations that collect, store and use data and is an extension of the old 95 directive highlighting the nessecity for transparency, disclosure and process. The new framework takes today's technological advancements into account which was not an issue in previous years. It is as much about ethics as it is about legality and gives the user more control over how their data is collected, stored and used. 
            The new law gives users the right to be informed, right of access, right to rectification, right to be forgotten(right to data deletion), right to restrict processing, right to data portability, right to object and rights in relation to automated decision making and profiling. Great news for users! 
             For businesses and developers, compliance means developing software that is GDPR compliant and in line with the Design with privacy framework. Data such as names, adresses, IP and Mac addresses, email, phone numbers, location data and cookies are included under the term 'personal information'. No longer can software be designed to extract, store and use personal information without consent. That is no longer an option. GDPR means adding privacy by design and data protection by default to your testing processes, which should supplement existing procedures such as penetration testing. Going forward, developers will be required to: Programme with transparancy; in the ways data is collected and used; Improve consent mechanisms and user controls; Execute projects and applications which provide optimal control over consent settings. The Privacy by Design framework is a seven-point development methodology which requires optimal data protection to be provided as standard, by default, across all uses and applications.
